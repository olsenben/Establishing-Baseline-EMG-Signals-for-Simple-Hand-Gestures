# Exploring the Possibility of Establishing Baseline EMG Signals for Simple Hand Guestures
### Prepared By Benjamin Olsen
Documentation is a pillar of healthcare and drives medical advancement, encourages growth as a community, and most importantly provides insurance companies with enough proof for them to reimburse medical treatments. In what may have been a previously unintended effect of healthcare insurance is that the administration of certain medical treatment is indirectly driven by what health insurance companies deem to be “reimbursable.” While whether or not this relationship between healthcare providers and insurance companies is ultimately beneficial to healthcare is open to debate, the reality of the situation is that no procedure is going to be considered “appropriate” if it cannot be practically and accurately documented. This is an issue that has held entire professions from breaking into the healthcare industry because insurance will not cover treatments if their outcomes cannot be convincingly documented. In terms of measuring skeletal muscular actions, usage of EMG data has thus far been popularly used as a diagnostic tool thanks to few difficulties in collecting the data, but has not been considered for documentation purposes mostly due to the noisiness of the data in EMGs. However, new advances in the area of signal decomposition may make it possible to establish a population baseline for EMG data associated with certain musculoskeletal motions, opening the possibility of using EMGs to document therapeutic progression of muscle rehabilitation. This would make documentation much easier to collect, and potentially make the healthcare industry more accessible to new therapies.
